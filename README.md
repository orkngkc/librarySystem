# librarySystem

this is a simple library system, automatically sorts the books according to the author's last name with insertion sort.
We have 4 functions, adding book, search by author, search by title, and displaying the books.
searching algorithms are linear search.

we have to include strutilis header and cpp files to make this searches case in-sensitive, and the books are stored with a vector of classes.
in order to use our book class we also have to include book header and cpp files too
